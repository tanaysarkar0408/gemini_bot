Chat App using Google Gemini AI.

I created this app using Google's new AI tool.
<br>

- I'll add the image recognition feature in the near future.

- I learnt how to use PostMan for API testing.

- I learnt basics of HTTP like GET,POST,etc.

- I made my BLOC Concept clear.

- And I created the UI on my own.
